                    <p> Juan Luna de San Pedro y Novicio Ancheta, who was more commonly known as Juan Luna, is regarded
                        as one of the first internationally renowned Filipino artist. Along with being an artist, he was
                        also a widely known political activist of the Philippine Revolution of the late 19th century.
                        Luna was as one of the first recognized painter and artist in the Philippines. His work was
                        focused on the European academics of his time and therefore, included a lot of depiction of
                        historical and literary scenes. Along with this, there was an underlining of political and
                        social commentary in his works which is highlighted by a slight touch of Romanticism.<br><br> Theatrical
                        scenes and dramatic poses were also on the forefront of Luna’s work. His paintings are generally
                        pronounced, conspicuous and vigorous. One of his most famous paintings, Spoliarium (1884), was
                        taken to Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in Madrid, where Luna was the first recipient of
                        the three gold medals awarded in the exhibition.
