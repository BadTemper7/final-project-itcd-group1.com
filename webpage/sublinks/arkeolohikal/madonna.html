                    <p> Vicente Manansala is a Filipino painter who was born in Macabebe, Pampanga, on January 22, 1920.
                        He was in the vanguard of the modernist movement in the country as a member of the Thirteen
                        Moderns and the Neo-Realists. With the exception of a few abstract paintings, Manansala's art
                        was always figurative. Manansala's paintings have been recognized as masterpieces that fused the
                        barrio andcity cultures. "Delicate tones, contours, and patterns of person and environment are
                        expertly juxtaposed," Manansala invented transparent cubism. The "Madonna of the Slums" is one
                        of his most famous artwork masterpieces.The Madonna of the Slums were created by Manansala in
                        the 1950 using a transparent cubism style. The scene in the Madonna of the Slums, like most of
                        Manansala's other masterpieces, was inspiredby the streets of Manila after the war. The painting
                        shows a woman and child from the rural who moved to the city and experienced poverty in postwar
                        Manila. The artwork depicts the difficulties faced by many Filipinos while living in the slums.
                        It conveys the sense that the lives of persons who reside in this place are unhappy, poor, and
                        unhealthy. Manansala emphasized the mother's and child's melancholy facial expressions, which
                        are mirrored by the typical slum scene of extreme poverty. The background depicts the typical
                        day in the lives of a slum dweller.
