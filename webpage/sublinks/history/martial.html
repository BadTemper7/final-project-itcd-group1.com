                    <p><b> THE PROCLAMATION OF MARTIAL LAW <br><br></b>Martial law was lifted by President Marcos on January 17, 1981, through Proclamation 2045. He
                        continued to rule the country until 1986 when he went to exile after the People Power
                        Revolution.However, Marcos retained virtually all of the executive powers he held as dictator,
                        through a combination of the 1972 constitution and the various decrees he had put in place
                        before Martial Law, which all remained in effect.Marcos issued Proclamation No. 1081, declaring
                        and imposing martial law in the entire country. This was six hours after the alleged
                        assassination attempt against Enrile . It also involved citing more than 15 bombing incidences,
                        chaos and lawlessness.
