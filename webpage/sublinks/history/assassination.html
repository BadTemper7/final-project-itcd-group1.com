                    <p> <b>THE ASSASSINATION’S OF POLITICAL RIVAL OF LATE DICTATOR FERDINAND MARCOS </b><br><br> Aquino Jr. popularly known as Ninoy, was a prominent political rival of the late Philippine
                        dictator Ferdinand Marcos. He was among the first arrested following the declaration of martial
                        law in 1972 .Aquino was sentenced to death by a military commission in 1977. However hewas never
                        executed and was allowed to seek medical aid and self-exile in the US.Aquino Jr. was
                        assassinated upon returning to the Philippines in 1983 — an event widely seen as being key to
                        Marcos’ downfall. In 1986, Marcos was replaced as president by Aquino Jr.’s wife, Corazon
                        Aquino.
