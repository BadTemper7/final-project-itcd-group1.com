                <div class="description">
                    <p> Andres Bonifacio is a prominent figure in Philippine history and is considered one of the
                        national heroes of the Philippines. He was born on November 30, 1863, in Tondo, Manila.
                        Bonifacio played a crucial role in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule in
                        the late 19th century.

                        Bonifacio founded the secret society known as the Katipunan in 1892. The Katipunan aimed to
                        achieve Philippine independence through armed resistance and revolution. Bonifacio became the
                        organization's leader, known by the title "Supremo." Under his leadership, the Katipunan grew
                        rapidly and became a significant force in the fight for independence.<br><br>

                        In August 1896, Bonifacio and the Katipunan launched an armed revolt against Spanish rule, which
                        marked the beginning of the Philippine Revolution. Despite not having formal military training,
                        Bonifacio displayed bravery and leadership during the early stages of the revolution.

                        Under Bonifacio's leadership, the Katipunan grew rapidly, and its membership spread throughout
                        the Philippines. In August 1896, he issued a cry for revolution known as the "Cry of Balintawak"
                        or "Cry of Pugad Lawin," which marked the beginning of the Philippine Revolution against Spain.<br><br>

                        Bonifacio's role in the revolution was pivotal, as he led his forces in several significant
                        battles against Spanish troops. However, he faced internal conflicts within the revolutionary
                        movement, particularly with Emilio Aguinaldo, another revolutionary leader. This eventually led
                        to a split, with Aguinaldo establishing a rival government.

                        Tragically, Bonifacio's life was cut short. In 1897, he was arrested by Aguinaldo's forces on
                        charges of treason and executed on May 10, 1897, in the mountains of Maragondon, Cavite. </p>
