                        THE EXPLOSION OF MOUNT PINATUBO IN 1991</b><br><br>During the nine-hour eruption, which happened in the Philippines, ash and other volcanic
                            elements were blasted up to 21 miles into the atmosphere. Many homes and farmlands were
                            destroyed, and thousands of people were killed as a result of the eruption, which also left
                            the surrounding area horribly damaged. Air travel was affected by the ashfall, which also
                            had a global effect by lowering temperatures all over the world. Volcanologists closely
                            followed the eruption and the governments worked hard to help the wounded residents.
