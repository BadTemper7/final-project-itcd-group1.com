                        THE PHILIPPINES INDEPENDENCE DAY 1946</b><br><br>This was a big international event. Though the Philippines did not yet have a Department of
                            Foreign Affairs. It had to rely on the US government for much of the preparations. May 1946
                            saw the start of a flurry of events to plan out the final days of the Commonwealth and
                            prepare for Independence Day. A joint Filipino-American committee was formed to iron out
                            details. The venue for the independence rites was chosen and a stage shaped in the form of a
                            shipâ€™s prow (symbolizing the ship of state) was built with towering pillars behind it. The
                            stage and grandstand were built in front of the iconic memorial of the Philippine national
                            hero, Jose Rizal, in Luneta Park. A large arch was erected near it, in front of the Manila
                            Hotel, to welcome visitors. As the month of July 1946 began, so did the numerous events and
                            preparations to climax in Philippine Independence on July 4.
