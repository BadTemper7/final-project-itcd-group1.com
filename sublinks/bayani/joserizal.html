                <div class="title" style="position:absolute; right:100px;"> Dr. Jose Rizal </div>
                    <div class="description">
                        <p> Jose Rizal was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines, which was then a colony
                        of Spain. His parents were Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso, both of whom were educated and
                        belonged to prominent families. Rizal was the seventh of eleven children. In 1872, Rizal
                        witnessed the execution of three Filipino priests who were accused of sedition. This event had a
                        profound impact on him and made him aware of the injustices and oppression that the Filipinos
                        experienced under the Spanish colonial government. He pursued his studies and eventually went to
                        study medicine in Spain, where he also became involved in the Propaganda Movement, a group of
                        Filipino expatriates who advocated for reforms in the Philippines. In 1887, Rizal published his
                        first novel, "Noli Me Tangere," which exposed the abuses and corruption of the Spanish colonial
                        government and clergy in the Philippines. <br><br>
                        
                        The book was banned in the Philippines but gained
                        widespread popularity and inspired many Filipinos to join the movement for independence. In
                        1891, Rizal published his second novel, "El Filibusterismo," which continued to expose the
                        injustices of the Spanish colonial government and the Catholic Church. In 1892, Rizal returned
                        to the Philippines and established the La Liga Filipina, a civic organization that aimed to
                        unite Filipinos and promote reforms peacefully. However, the organization was disbanded after
                        Rizal's arrest and exile to Dapitan, where he continued to practice medicine and engage in
                        agricultural activities. In 1896, the Philippine Revolution broke out, and Rizal was implicated
                        in the rebellion. He was arrested, tried, and convicted of sedition, rebellion, and conspiracy.
                        On December 30, 1896, Rizal was executed by firing squad in Manila. His death sparked widespread
                        outrage and led to the intensification of the revolution. Rizal's life and writings continue to
                        inspire Filipinos and people around the world to fight for justice, freedom, and national
                        sovereignty. He is now regarded as a national hero in the Philippines, and his life and works
                        are celebrated every year on Rizal Day, which falls on December 30. </p>
